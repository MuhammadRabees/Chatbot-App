 # 🤖 AI Chatbot (Android)
 This is a modern, native Android chatbot application built with Kotlin. It is inspired by the design of ChatGPT and utilizes the gpt-4o model via OpenRouter to understand both text and image-based messages.

Ask questions not just with text, but also about images using gpt-4o vision capabilities.

Local Chat History: Every chat session, along with its messages, is saved locally on the user's phone using a Room Database.

Session Management: A ChatGPT-like side panel (Navigation Drawer) where all your past chat history is accessible.

"New Chat" Functionality: The app always starts with a fresh, blank "New Chat" screen.

"Thinking..." Indicator: Displays a "Thinking..." or "Analyzing image..." message while waiting for the bot's response.

Modern Android UI: Built with DrawerLayout, RecyclerView, and ViewBinding.

# 🚀 Getting Started
You only need 3 steps to run this project:

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/MuhammadRabees/ChatBot.git](https://github.com/MuhammadRabees/ChatBot.git)

# 2. Get API Key
   This app uses OpenRouter.ai for its API calls.
   
   Create an account on https://openrouter.ai. Copy your API Key.
# 3. Create local.properties file
In your project's root folder (where gradle.properties is located), create a new file named local.properties.

Add your API key to this file as follows:

OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-or-your-openrouter-api-key-here"

Your build.gradle file will automatically pick up this key.
# 4. Build & Run
That's it! You can now build and run the project in Android Studio.
  
# 🏛️ Architecture
This project follows a clean MVVM architecture:

View (Activity/Fragment): MainActivity.kt which only handles UI events (clicks) and observes data from the ViewModel.

ViewModel (ChatViewModel.kt): Acts as a bridge between the UI and the Repository. It handles all business logic (like managing sessions).

Repository (ChatRepository.kt): The single source of truth for data. It decides whether to fetch data from the Room Database (local 
cache) or Retrofit (remote network).

Model (Message.kt, ChatSession.kt): Database tables (@Entity) and data classes.
